                                It is through my tears and with the heaviest of hearts that I am making this difficult
                                announcement. Last night, February 19, 2021, my Father, Frederick R. Fritzen passed away
                                peacefully with me by his side.

                                My father was an incredible man. He was a strong, loving, caring, fun, hard-working,
                                hard headed at times, Harley Davidson loving man. He was also generous and kind – always
                                helping those in need. He loved stock car racing & Fonda Speedway where he was part of
                                my Uncle Eddie Pieniazek’s pit crew.

                                Many of you already know parts of our story. In 2013 Dad had a major stroke followed by
                                a few months of rehabilitation. He partially recovered, however was left unable to care
                                for himself and our business. In 2014, after 25+ years in Florida, I moved back to New
                                York to care for him and our family business, The Horses Lounge. In 2018, along with the
                                onset of Dementia, he suffered another major stroke which rendered him unable to walk
                                and experiencing speech difficulties. I made the very difficult decision to place him at
                                Baptist Health, so that he could receive the 24 hour care that he needed.

                                Many of you have fond memories of him and your times with him at the bar, camp, and so
                                many other outings and events. I invite all of you to share your stories and memories of
                                him with us. I love hearing the stories, and right now, I need to hear them again.

                                I’ll share a poignant story with you now:

                                In 2014, after I moved back to Schenectady, Dad came into our office and sat down next
                                to me. He handed me his father’s family ring, and said “I want you to have this - it’s
                                time”. At that moment “the torch” was passed from Father to Son.

                                That same day, I made a vow to my father that I would continue his legacy in the best
                                manor I knew how. I have some pretty big shoes to fill, even though his feet are much
                                smaller than mine. I will never forget that very special day.

                                I want to thank our families, friends, loved ones and regulars (near and far), for the
                                love and compassion you have shown to us over the years and especially in the last 24
                                hours. I will miss my father deeply, but I know he is now at peace. The pandemic robbed
                                us of a year that should have been spent together and I’m upset by that loss of time. I
                                can never get that back. But I am thankful he was safe and well taken care of.

                                Death is a part of life, and his was a life well lived. In his final moments, as he took
                                his last breath, a tear ran down his face from his right eye. I want to believe it was a
                                tear of happiness and relief that he was heading home and is now at peace.
